# NetCrackPi

The Network-Cracking-Pi is essentially a collective download candidate to turn your raspberry pi into a Network Cracker (for educational purposes of course).
With NetCrackPi users don't have break the bank for a PenTesting laptop to change the OS on, instead for $35 the Raspberry Pi can act as their Network Cracking hidden weapon.
